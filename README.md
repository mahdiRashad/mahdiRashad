Hi! My interest in computers 🖥️ 💻 started when I was kid. Seeing my older brothers tinkering their computer to get better performance in games made me passionate about making computers efficient and faster. My passion and interest drove me to study computer science at UIC where I learned different programming languages, teamwork in group projects, enhanced efficiency in algorithms, building embedded systems, etc.
I am working at UIC Richard J. Daley Library with the Information Technology team where I collaborate daily with technicians, librarians, and faculty to make the library a better place for the students and staff to learn and develop.
Now I am thrilled to apply all I have to the real world, starting from software to increase efficiency, enhance algorithms, and make user interface easier to use. Moving into hardware to reduce power consumption, better compact design, and less head emission.
