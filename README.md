Hi! My interest in computers started when I was kid. Seeing my older brothers tinkering their computers to get better performance in games made me passionate about making computers efficient and faster. My passion and interest drove me to study computer science at UIC where I learned different programming languages, teamwork in group projects, enhanced efficiency in algorithms, building embedded systems, etc. I am very excited to graduate in Fall 2026 and start to apply what I have learned in real world application.

I am working at UIC Richard J. Daley Library with the Information Technology team where I collaborate daily with technicians, librarians, and faculty to make the library a better place for the students and staff to learn and develop. Working with the IT team helped me gain a lot of experience in problem solving, documentation, security mindset, time management, and more. Over the past five years in Information Technology, I have progressed from Computer Specialist I to Computer Specialist II, demonstrating my ability to take on increasing responsibility and deliver reliable solutions. I am passionate about using my IT expertise, programming background, and customer-focused approach to create meaningful technological improvements that support both academic and professional communities.

Looking ahead, I am excited to apply my combined IT and computer science expertise to impactful projects. My goals include developing software that enhances efficiency, improves algorithms, and streamlines user interfaces, as well as contributing to hardware innovations that reduce power consumption, improve design, and minimize carbon emissions.
