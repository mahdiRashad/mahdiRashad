My journey in computer science began in childhood, inspired by watching my older brothers tinker with their computers to boost gaming performance. That early curiosity grew into a passion for building efficient systems, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at UIC. There, I’ve gained hands-on experience with multiple programming languages, algorithms, embedded systems, and collaborative projects. I look forward to graduating in Fall 2026 and apply my skills to real-world applications.

Currently, I work with the Information Technology team at UIC’s Richard J. Daley Library, collaborating with technicians, librarians, and faculty to enhance the library’s learning environment. This role has provided extensive experience in troubleshooting, documentation, security practices, and time management. Over the past five years in IT, I advanced from Computer Specialist I to II, reflecting my ability to take on greater responsibility and deliver reliable solutions. I am committed to combining my IT expertise, programming skills, and customer-focused approach to drive meaningful technological improvements.

Looking ahead, I am excited to apply my combined IT and computer science expertise to impactful projects. My goals include developing software that enhances efficiency, improves algorithms, and streamlines user interfaces, as well as contributing to hardware innovations that reduce power consumption, improve design, and minimize carbon emissions.

Beyond the professional realm, I enjoy hardware tinkering, especially building and optimizing gaming PCs, where I enjoy selecting compatible components, assembling systems, and optimizing performance through overclocking and cooling solutions. I also like experimenting with different hardware configurations to better understand how technology works, troubleshoot issues, and push the limits of system efficiency. This hobby not only fuels my curiosity but also sharpens my problem-solving skills and keeps me engaged with the latest trends in computing technology.
