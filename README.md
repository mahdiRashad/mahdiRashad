Hi! My interest in computers 🖥️ 💻  started when I was kid, seeing my older brothers tinkering thier computer to get better performance at games made me passionate about making computers efficient and faster.
My passion and interest drive me ot computer scince at UIC where I learned different programming languages, teamwork in group projects, bulding efficiency in algorithms, bulding embedded systems, etc
Now I am excited to apply all I have to the real word, starting at software to increase efficience, inhance algorithms, and making user intrface easier to use.
Moving into hardware to reduce power comsubtion, better compact design, and less head immesiom.
